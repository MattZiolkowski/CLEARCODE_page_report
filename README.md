#Hack_Power.py#

Hack_power calculator deciphers a code written using strings and assign values
to given letters and phrases. Values are assigned to letters and phrases as following:
Letters: {'a':1,'b':2, 'c':3}; Phrases: {'ba':10, 'baa':20}
Additionally, each letter in the code is multiplied by number of occurrences of that letter.

Example(with phrases): Code 'abaa' has power=(1*1)+(1*2)+(1*2)+(2*1)+(3*1)+(20)=28.
